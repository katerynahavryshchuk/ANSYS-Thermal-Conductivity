<h1>Thermal Conductivity Studies</h1>

It is known that thermal conductivity generally decreases with DPA due to structural defects, such as vacancies and voids. The provided script relies on ANSYS predictions of how the maximum temperature and equivalent stress of the target irradiated with the 8 GeV proton beam change when the thermal conductivity decreases by factors of 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. These predictions are fit with inverse functions, and the results are extrapolated to estimate the safety factors for each material of interest.
